# vimwiki_link_network
This is a project to help me explore, analyze, and visualize the network
created by my Vimwiki. It's definitely a work in progress, but it will be
updated as needed. I haven't made it `pip install`-able yet, but that is soon
to come.

Feel free to email me or open issues or PRs.
